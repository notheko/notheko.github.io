My name is Nora Koch, I am a Business Psychologist (B.A.) with a focus on Human Ressource Management. 
After taking a year off between school and university I decided I would like to combine my passion for psychology with a healthy dose of business, which led me to study exactly that in the small town of [Heide, North Germany] (https://www.fh-westkueste.de/wipsy/).

I enjoy working with different people on individual tasks, hence my passion for HR Development, especiall trainings and workshops.
