My name is Nora Koch, I am an Organizational Psychologist with a focus on Human Ressource Management, currently based in Heide, Holstein.

Taking a year off to travel after school, I decided I would like to combine my passion for psychology with a healthy dose of business, which led me to study exactly that - [Business Psychology](https://www.fh-westkueste.de/wipsy/) - in the small town of Heide, North Germany.

While I enjoyed the theoretical insights into statistics, (social)psychology and behaviour, I quickly realized that my passion lies in the practical use of psychology in every-day work issues, such as workshops, seminars and change management.

You can find a selection of my projects on this webside, ranging from essays and papers, to seminars we designed.
